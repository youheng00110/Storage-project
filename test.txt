1  We all know that having too much work and too much stress can lead to burnout, but did you know that the opposite can also be a problem? Have you ever felt that your job was too easy and that everything was just a bit too boring? If so, you might be suffering from rust out.

2  Rust out happens when there isn't enough challenge to motivate you to keep going in your job. Without some challenge, it can be hard to feel growth in your role. If a job has lots of repetitive and monotonous tasks, it can make it hard to see the purpose of a role. Having a lower level of responsibility at work than before can also make it harder to feel fulfilled in a job. This can affect people who have taken time out from their career for family or personal reasons.

3  If you think that you might be suffering from rust out, then there are a number of signs to watch out for. You might dread finding your schedule each week and not seeing anything stimulating on it. It might be that you often find yourself clock-watching at work, willing the time to pass. Focus and motivation can drop, leading you to get less done than you had before, or to make more mistakes. You may start to feel apathetic and disengaged towards your job. These feelings can lead to anxiety and depression which can then spread from work into people's personal lives.

4  Finding yourself suffering from rust out can sometimes be an opportunity. Some experts suggest that self-awareness is key. By taking some time to realise what you are really looking for in work and life, you can take steps to re-discover your motivation. Setting yourself goals and allowing yourself to try new things can help you find a new purpose. Considering what you really need for a job can also lead you to find a new one that's better suited to your goals in life.
