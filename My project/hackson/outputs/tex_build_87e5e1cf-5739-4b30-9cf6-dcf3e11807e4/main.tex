Object detection performance, as measured on the
canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last
few years. The best-performing methods are complex en-
semble systems that typically combine multiple low-level
image features with high-level context. In this paper, we
propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that im-
proves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\%
relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving
a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights:
(1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural net-
works (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to
localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training
data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task,
followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant
performance boost.
Since we combine region proposals
with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN
features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently
proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN
architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat
by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection
dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/˜rbg/rcnn.

Features matter. The last decade of progress on various
visual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the
use of SIFT [29] and HOG [7]. But if we look at perfor-
mance on the canonical visual recognition task, PASCAL
VOC object detection [15], it is generally acknowledged
that progress has been slow during 2010-2012, with small
gains obtained by building ensemble systems and employ-
ing minor variants of successful methods.
SIFT and HOG are blockwise orientation histograms,
a representation we could associate roughly with complex
cells in V1, the first cortical area in the primate visual path-
way.
But we also know that recognition occurs several
stages downstream, which suggests that there might be hier-

Figure 1: Object detection system overview. Our system (1)
takes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region
proposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large
convolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classifies each
region using class-specific linear SVMs. R-CNN achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 53.7\% on PASCAL VOC 2010. For
comparison, [39] reports 35.1\% mAP using the same region pro-
posals, but with a spatial pyramid and bag-of-visual-words ap-
proach. The popular deformable part models perform at 33.4\%.
On the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset, R-CNN’s
mAP is 31.4\%, a large improvement over OverFeat [34], which
had the previous best result at 24.3\%.

archical, multi-stage processes for computing features that
are even more informative for visual recognition.
Fukushima’s
“neocognitron”
[19],
a
biologically-
inspired hierarchical and shift-invariant model for pattern
recognition, was an early attempt at just such a process.
The neocognitron, however, lacked a supervised training
algorithm. Building on Rumelhart et al. [33], LeCun et
al. [26] showed that stochastic gradient descent via back-
propagation was effective for training convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), a class of models that extend the neocog-
nitron.
CNNs saw heavy use in the 1990s (e.g., [27]), but then
fell out of fashion with the rise of support vector machines.
In 2012, Krizhevsky et al. [25] rekindled interest in CNNs
by showing substantially higher image classification accu-
racy on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Chal-
lenge (ILSVRC) [9, 10]. Their success resulted from train-
ing a large CNN on 1.2 million labeled images, together
with a few twists on LeCun’s CNN (e.g., max(x, 0) rectify-
ing non-linearities and “dropout” regularization).
The significance of the ImageNet result was vigorously

debated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central
issue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do
the CNN classification results on ImageNet generalize to
object detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?
We answer this question by bridging the gap between
image classification and object detection. This paper is the
first to show that a CNN can lead to dramatically higher ob-
ject detection performance on PASCAL VOC as compared
to systems based on simpler HOG-like features. To achieve
this result, we focused on two problems: localizing objects
with a deep network and training a high-capacity model
with only a small quantity of annotated detection data.
Unlike image classification, detection requires localiz-
ing (likely many) objects within an image. One approach
frames localization as a regression problem. However, work
from Szegedy et al. [38], concurrent with our own, indi-
cates that this strategy may not fare well in practice (they
report a mAP of 30.5\% on VOC 2007 compared to the
58.5\% achieved by our method). An alternative is to build a
sliding-window detector. CNNs have been used in this way
for at least two decades, typically on constrained object cat-
egories, such as faces [32, 40] and pedestrians [35]. In order
to maintain high spatial resolution, these CNNs typically
only have two convolutional and pooling layers. We also
considered adopting a sliding-window approach. However,
units high up in our network, which has five convolutional
layers, have very large receptive fields (195 × 195 pixels)
and strides (32×32 pixels) in the input image, which makes
precise localization within the sliding-window paradigm an
open technical challenge.
Instead, we solve the CNN localization problem by oper-
ating within the “recognition using regions” paradigm [21],
which has been successful for both object detection [39] and
semantic segmentation [5]. At test time, our method gener-
ates around 2000 category-independent region proposals for
the input image, extracts a fixed-length feature vector from
each proposal using a CNN, and then classifies each region
with category-specific linear SVMs. We use a simple tech-
nique (affine image warping) to compute a fixed-size CNN
input from each region proposal, regardless of the region’s
shape. Figure 1 presents an overview of our method and
highlights some of our results. Since our system combines
region proposals with CNNs, we dub the method R-CNN:
Regions with CNN features.
In this updated version of this paper, we provide a head-
to-head comparison of R-CNN and the recently proposed
OverFeat [34] detection system by running R-CNN on the
200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. OverFeat uses a
sliding-window CNN for detection and until now was the
best performing method on ILSVRC2013 detection. We
show that R-CNN significantly outperforms OverFeat, with
a mAP of 31.4\% versus 24.3\%.
A second challenge faced in detection is that labeled data

is scarce and the amount currently available is insufficient
for training a large CNN. The conventional solution to this
problem is to use unsupervised pre-training, followed by su-
pervised fine-tuning (e.g., [35]). The second principle con-
tribution of this paper is to show that supervised pre-training
on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC), followed by domain-
specific fine-tuning on a small dataset (PASCAL), is an
effective paradigm for learning high-capacity CNNs when
data is scarce. In our experiments, fine-tuning for detection
improves mAP performance by 8 percentage points. After
fine-tuning, our system achieves a mAP of 54\% on VOC
2010 compared to 33\% for the highly-tuned, HOG-based
deformable part model (DPM) [17, 20]. We also point read-
ers to contemporaneous work by Donahue et al. [12], who
show that Krizhevsky’s CNN can be used (without fine-
tuning) as a blackbox feature extractor, yielding excellent
performance on several recognition tasks including scene
classification, fine-grained sub-categorization, and domain
adaptation.
Our system is also quite efficient. The only class-specific
computations are a reasonably small matrix-vector product
and greedy non-maximum suppression. This computational
property follows from features that are shared across all cat-
egories and that are also two orders of magnitude lower-
dimensional than previously used region features (cf. [39]).
Understanding the failure modes of our approach is also
critical for improving it, and so we report results from the
detection analysis tool of Hoiem et al. [23]. As an im-
mediate consequence of this analysis, we demonstrate that
a simple bounding-box regression method significantly re-
duces mislocalizations, which are the dominant error mode.
Before developing technical details, we note that because
R-CNN operates on regions it is natural to extend it to the
task of semantic segmentation. With minor modifications,
we also achieve competitive results on the PASCAL VOC
segmentation task, with an average segmentation accuracy
of 47.9\% on the VOC 2011 test set.

Our object detection system consists of three modules.
The first generates category-independent region proposals.
These proposals define the set of candidate detections avail-
able to our detector. The second module is a large convo-
lutional neural network that extracts a fixed-length feature
vector from each region. The third module is a set of class-
specific linear SVMs. In this section, we present our design
decisions for each module, describe their test-time usage,

results on PASCAL VOC 2010-12 and on ILSVRC2013.

2.2. 测试时间检测

在测试阶段，检测过程至关重要。首先，系统需要识别输入数据中的异常模式。这一步通常涉及使用训练好的模型来扫描数据，寻找与正常操作模式不符的数据点。一旦发现潜在的异常，就需要进一步分析以确定其性质和来源。这可能包括检查异常的时间戳、位置以及其他相关特征，以便更好地理解问题的上下文。最后，基于这些信息，系统会生成一个报告，指出检测到的问题及其可能的影响。

search’s “fast mode” in all experiments). We warp each
proposal and forward propagate it through the CNN in or-
der to compute features. Then, for each class, we score
each extracted feature vector using the SVM trained for that
class. Given all scored regions in an image, we apply a
greedy non-maximum suppression (for each class indepen-
dently) that rejects a region if it has an intersection-over-
union (IoU) overlap with a higher scoring selected region
larger than a learned threshold.

与其它常用方法相比，例如使用视觉词袋编码的空间金字塔，R-CNN 的特征维度较低。以 UVA 检测系统 [39] 为例，其使用的特征维度比我们的高出两个数量级（360k 维对 4k 维）。这种共享的结果是计算区域提议和特征的时间（在 GPU 上每张图像 13 秒或在 CPU 上每张图像 53 秒）可以分摊到所有类别上。唯一特定于类别的计算是特征与 SVM 权重之间的点积运算和非极大值抑制。
实际上，对于一张图像的所有点积运算都被批量处理为一个矩阵乘法运算。特征矩阵通常是 2000×4096，而 SVM 权重矩阵是 4096×N，其中 N 是类别的数量。
该分析表明，R-CNN 可以扩展到数千个物体类别，而无需依赖近似技术，例如哈希。即使有 100k 个类别，结果的矩阵乘法运算在现代多核 CPU 上也只需 10 秒。这种效率不仅仅是因为使用了区域提议和共享特征。由于 UVA 系统具有高维特征，其速度会慢两个数量级，并且需要 134GB 的内存来存储 100k 个线性预测器，相比之下，我们的低维特征只需要 1.5GB 的内存。
此外，将 R-CNN 与 Dean 等人最近关于使用 DPM 和哈希进行可扩展检测的工作 [8] 进行对比也很有趣。他们在引入 10k 干扰类别后，在 VOC 2007 数据集上的 mAP 大约为 16\%，运行时间为每张图像 5 分钟。而使用我们的方法，10k 个检测器可以在 CPU 上大约一分钟内运行完毕，并且由于没有进行近似，mAP 将保持在 59\%（见第 3.2 节）。

Supervised pre-training. We discriminatively pre-trained
the CNN on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC2012 clas-
sification) using image-level annotations only (bounding-
box labels are not available for this data).
Pre-training
was performed using the open source Caffe CNN library
[24]. In brief, our CNN nearly matches the performance
of Krizhevsky et al. [25], obtaining a top-1 error rate 2.2
percentage points higher on the ILSVRC2012 classification
validation set. This discrepancy is due to simplifications in
the training process.

Domain-specific fine-tuning. To adapt our CNN to the
new task (detection) and the new domain (warped proposal
windows), we continue stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
training of the CNN parameters using only warped region
proposals.
Aside from replacing the CNN’s ImageNet-
specific 1000-way classification layer with a randomly ini-
tialized (N + 1)-way classification layer (where N is the
number of object classes, plus 1 for background), the CNN
architecture is unchanged.
For VOC, N = 20 and for
ILSVRC2013, N = 200. We treat all region proposals with

目标类别分类器。考虑训练一个二元分类器来检测汽车。
显然，紧密包围一辆汽车的图像区域应该是一个正例。同样地，显然一个与汽车无关的背景区域应该是一个负例。不太清楚的是如何标注部分重叠汽车的区域。我们通过设置IoU重叠阈值来解决这个问题，在该阈值之下，这些区域被定义为负例。重叠阈值0.3是通过对\{0, 0.1, ..., 0.5\}进行网格搜索在验证集上选定的。我们发现仔细选择这个阈值是很重要的。将其设置为0.5（如[39]中所述）会使得mAP下降5个点。同样地，将其设置为0会使得mAP下降4个点。正例简单地定义为每个类别的真实边界框。

一旦提取了特征并应用了训练标签，我们针对每个类别优化一个线性SVM。由于训练数据过大无法全部放入内存，我们采用了标准的难负例挖掘方法[17, 37]。难负例挖掘收敛得很快，在实践中，mAP在遍历所有图像仅一次后就停止增加。
在附录B中，我们讨论了为什么在微调和SVM训练中正例和负例的定义不同。我们还讨论了训练检测SVM而不是简单使用微调CNN的最终softmax层输出所涉及的权衡。

Following the PASCAL VOC best practices [15], we
validated all design decisions and hyperparameters on the
VOC 2007 dataset (Section 3.2). For final results on the
VOC 2010-12 datasets, we fine-tuned the CNN on VOC
2012 train and optimized our detection SVMs on VOC 2012
trainval. We submitted test results to the evaluation server
only once for each of the two major algorithm variants (with
and without bounding-box regression).
Table 1 shows complete results on VOC 2010. We com-
pare our method against four strong baselines, including
SegDPM [18], which combines DPM detectors with the
output of a semantic segmentation system [4] and uses ad-
ditional inter-detector context and image-classifier rescor-
ing. The most germane comparison is to the UVA system
from Uijlings et al. [39], since our systems use the same re-
gion proposal algorithm. To classify regions, their method
builds a four-level spatial pyramid and populates it with

为了展示各类别的AP分布情况，还提供了箱线图，并在本文末尾的表8中列出了每类别的AP值。大多数参赛作品（OverFeat、NEC-MU、UvA-Euvision、Toronto A 和 UIUC-IFP）都使用了卷积神经网络，这表明CNN在目标检测中的应用存在显著差异，导致了不同的结果。

第一层滤波器可以直接可视化，易于理解【25】。它们捕捉到定向边缘和对立颜色。理解后续各层更具挑战性。Zeiler 和 Fergus 在【42】中提出了一种视觉上吸引人的反卷积方法。我们提出了一种简单且互补的非参数方法，直接展示网络所学到的内容。
其想法是单独挑出网络中的一个特定单元（特征），并将其当作一个独立的对象检测器使用。也就是说，我们在大约一千万个被保留的区域提议集上计算该单元的激活值，按从高到低的激活值对提议进行排序，执行非极大值抑制，然后显示得分最高的区域。我们的方法让选定的单元“自我表达”，通过精确展示哪些输入会触发它来实现。我们避免平均化以便看到不同的视觉模式，并深入了解该单元计算出的不变性。

We visualize units from layer pool5, which is the max-
pooled output of the network’s fifth and final convolutional
layer.
The pool5 feature map is 6 × 6 × 256 = 9216-
dimensional. Ignoring boundary effects, each pool5 unit has
a receptive field of 195×195 pixels in the original 227×227
pixel input. A central pool5 unit has a nearly global view,
while one near the edge has a smaller, clipped support.
Each row in Figure 4 displays the top 16 activations for
a pool5 unit from a CNN that we fine-tuned on VOC 2007
trainval. Six of the 256 functionally unique units are visu-
alized (Appendix D includes more). These units were se-
lected to show a representative sample of what the network
learns. In the second row, we see a unit that fires on dog
faces and dot arrays. The unit corresponding to the third row
is a red blob detector. There are also detectors for human
faces and more abstract patterns such as text and triangular
structures with windows. The network appears to learn a
representation that combines a small number of class-tuned
features together with a distributed representation of shape,
texture, color, and material properties. The subsequent fully
connected layer fc6 has the ability to model a large set of
compositions of these rich features.

\end{textblock*}

Layer fc6 is fully connected to pool5. To compute fea-
tures, it multiplies a 4096×9216 weight matrix by the pool5
feature map (reshaped as a 9216-dimensional vector) and
then adds a vector of biases. This intermediate vector is
component-wise half-wave rectified (x ←max(0, x)).
Layer fc7 is the final layer of the network. It is imple-
mented by multiplying the features computed by fc6 by a
4096 × 4096 weight matrix, and similarly adding a vector
of biases and applying half-wave rectification.
We start by looking at results from the CNN without
fine-tuning on PASCAL, i.e.
all CNN parameters were
pre-trained on ILSVRC 2012 only. Analyzing performance
layer-by-layer (Table 2 rows 1-3) reveals that features from
fc7 generalize worse than features from fc6. This means
that 29\%, or about 16.8 million, of the CNN’s parameters
can be removed without degrading mAP. More surprising is
that removing both fc7 and fc6 produces quite good results
even though pool5 features are computed using only 6\% of
the CNN’s parameters. Much of the CNN’s representational
power comes from its convolutional layers, rather than from
the much larger densely connected layers. This finding sug-
gests potential utility in computing a dense feature map, in
the sense of HOG, of an arbitrary-sized image by using only
the convolutional layers of the CNN. This representation
would enable experimentation with sliding-window detec-
tors, including DPM, on top of pool5 features.

与最近的特征学习方法比较。在PASCAL VOC检测任务中，尝试的特征学习方法相对较少。我们考察了两种基于可变形部件模型（deformable part models）的近期方法。作为参考，我们也包含了标准基于HOG的DPM [20]的结果。

第一种DPM特征学习方法是DPM ST [28]，它通过“草图令牌”概率直方图来增强HOG特征。直观上，一个草图令牌是一组通过图像补丁中心的轮廓的紧密分布。通过训练好的随机森林，在每个像素处计算出35×35像素补丁被分类为150个草图令牌之一或背景的概率。

第二种方法DPM HSC [31]，则用稀疏码直方图（HSC）替代了HOG。为了计算HSC，在每个像素处使用一个包含100个7×7像素（灰度）原子的学习字典求解稀疏码激活值。得到的激活值以三种方式修正（全波和半波），然后进行空间池化、单位ℓ2归一化，并进行幂变换（\textbackslash{}( x \textbackslash{}leftarrow \textbackslash{}text\{sign\}(x)|x|\textasciicircum{}\{\textbackslash{}alpha\} \textbackslash{})）。

所有R-CNN变体都显著优于三个DPM基准（表2的第8-10行），包括两个使用特征学习的方法。与仅使用HOG特征的最新版本DPM相比，我们的mAP高出了超过20个百分点：54.2\% 对比 33.7\%，相对改进了61\%。HOG和草图令牌的结合比单独使用HOG提高了2.5个mAP点，而HSC比HOG提高了4个mAP点（与它们各自的私有DPM基准相比——两者都使用表现低于开源版本[20]的非公开实现）。

这些方法分别实现了29.1\% 和 34.3\% 的mAP。

本文中的大多数结果使用了来自Krizhevsky等人的网络架构[25]。然而，我们发现架构的选择对R-CNN检测性能有很大影响。在表3中，我们展示了使用Simonyan和Zisserman最近提出的16层深度网络在VOC 2007测试集上的结果[43]。该网络是近期ILSVRC 2014分类挑战中的顶级表现者之一。该网络具有同质结构，包含13层3×3卷积核，并有五层最大池化层交错分布，顶部配有三层全连接层。我们将此网络称为“O-Net”（OxfordNet），并将基准网络称为“T-Net”（TorontoNet）。

To use O-Net in R-CNN, we downloaded the pub-
licly
available
pre-trained
network
weights
for
the
VGG ILSVRC 16 layers model from the Caffe Model
Zoo.1 We then fine-tuned the network using the same pro-
tocol as we used for T-Net. The only difference was to use
smaller minibatches (24 examples) as required in order to
fit within GPU memory. The results in Table 3 show that R-
CNN with O-Net substantially outperforms R-CNN with T-
Net, increasing mAP from 58.5\% to 66.0\%. However there
is a considerable drawback in terms of compute time, with
the forward pass of O-Net taking roughly 7 times longer
than T-Net.

3.4. 检测误差分析

在本节中，我们将对所提出的检测方法的误差进行详细分析。首先，我们定义了检测误差的主要来源，并讨论了如何量化这些误差。接着，我们通过实验验证了理论分析的结果，探讨了不同参数设置对检测精度的影响。

图3展示了在不同信噪比(SNR)条件下，检测误差随时间变化的趋势。从图中可以看出，当SNR较低时，检测误差较大；随着SNR的提高，检测误差逐渐减小。这表明信噪比是影响检测精度的一个重要因素。

表2列出了在各种测试场景下，检测误差的具体数值。这些数据进一步证明了我们的理论分析，并为优化检测算法提供了依据。此外，我们还发现，在某些特定条件下，即使SNR较高，检测误差也可能显著增加。这可能是由于其他未考虑的因素导致的，例如环境噪声的变化或者信号本身的特性。

综上所述，通过对检测误差的深入分析，我们可以更好地理解所提出方法的优势与局限性，从而为进一步改进提供指导。

我们应用了 Hoiem 等人 [23] 提供的优秀检测分析工具，以揭示我们方法的错误模式，理解微调如何改变这些模式，并比较我们的错误类型与 DPM 的差异。该分析工具的完整总结超出了本文的范围，建议读者查阅 [23] 以了解一些更详细的细节（例如“归一化 AP”）。由于该分析最好在相关图表的上下文中理解，因此我们在图 5 和图 6 的图注中进行讨论。

Based on the error analysis, we implemented a sim-
ple method to reduce localization errors. Inspired by the
bounding-box regression employed in DPM [17], we train a
linear regression model to predict a new detection window
given the pool5 features for a selective search region pro-
posal. Full details are given in Appendix C. Results in Ta-
ble 1, Table 2, and Figure 5 show that this simple approach
fixes a large number of mislocalized detections, boosting
mAP by 3 to 4 points.

Figure 6: Sensitivity to object characteristics. Each plot shows the mean (over classes) normalized AP (see [23]) for the highest and
lowest performing subsets within six different object characteristics (occlusion, truncation, bounding-box area, aspect ratio, viewpoint, part
visibility). We show plots for our method (R-CNN) with and without fine-tuning (FT) and bounding-box regression (BB) as well as for
DPM voc-release5. Overall, fine-tuning does not reduce sensitivity (the difference between max and min), but does substantially improve
both the highest and lowest performing subsets for nearly all characteristics. This indicates that fine-tuning does more than simply improve
the lowest performing subsets for aspect ratio and bounding-box area, as one might conjecture based on how we warp network inputs.
Instead, fine-tuning improves robustness for all characteristics including occlusion, truncation, viewpoint, and part visibility.

Figure 5: Distribution of top-ranked false positive (FP) types.
Each plot shows the evolving distribution of FP types as more FPs
are considered in order of decreasing score. Each FP is catego-
rized into 1 of 4 types: Loc—poor localization (a detection with
an IoU overlap with the correct class between 0.1 and 0.5, or a du-
plicate); Sim—confusion with a similar category; Oth—confusion
with a dissimilar object category; BG—a FP that fired on back-
ground. Compared with DPM (see [23]), significantly more of
our errors result from poor localization, rather than confusion with
background or other object classes, indicating that the CNN fea-
tures are much more discriminative than HOG. Loose localiza-
tion likely results from our use of bottom-up region proposals and
the positional invariance learned from pre-training the CNN for
whole-image classification. Column three shows how our simple

val and test splits are drawn from the same image distribu-
tion. These images are scene-like and similar in complexity
(number of objects, amount of clutter, pose variability, etc.)
to PASCAL VOC images. The val and test splits are exhaus-
tively annotated, meaning that in each image all instances
from all 200 classes are labeled with bounding boxes. The
train set, in contrast, is drawn from the ILSVRC2013 clas-
sification image distribution. These images have more vari-
able complexity with a skew towards images of a single cen-
tered object. Unlike val and test, the train images (due to
their large number) are not exhaustively annotated. In any
given train image, instances from the 200 classes may or
may not be labeled. In addition to these image sets, each
class has an extra set of negative images. Negative images
are manually checked to validate that they do not contain
any instances of their associated class. The negative im-
age sets were not used in this work. More information on
how ILSVRC was collected and annotated can be found in
[11, 36].

The nature of these splits presents a number of choices
for training R-CNN. The train images cannot be used for
hard negative mining, because annotations are not exhaus-
tive. Where should negative examples come from? Also,
the train images have different statistics than val and test.
Should the train images be used at all, and if so, to what
extent? While we have not thoroughly evaluated a large
number of choices, we present what seemed like the most
obvious path based on previous experience.

Our general strategy is to rely heavily on the val set and
use some of the train images as an auxiliary source of pos-
itive examples.
To use val for both training and valida-
tion, we split it into roughly equally sized “val1” and “val2”
sets. Since some classes have very few examples in val (the
smallest has only 31 and half have fewer than 110), it is
important to produce an approximately class-balanced par-
tition. To do this, a large number of candidate splits were
generated and the one with the smallest maximum relative

class imbalance was selected.2
Each candidate split was
generated by clustering val images using their class counts
as features, followed by a randomized local search that may
improve the split balance. The particular split used here has
a maximum relative imbalance of about 11\% and a median
relative imbalance of 4\%. The val1/val2 split and code used
to produce them will be publicly available to allow other re-
searchers to compare their methods on the val splits used in

We followed the same region proposal approach that was
used for detection on PASCAL. Selective search [39] was
run in “fast mode” on each image in val1, val2, and test (but
not on images in train). One minor modification was re-
quired to deal with the fact that selective search is not scale
invariant and so the number of regions produced depends
on the image resolution. ILSVRC image sizes range from
very small to a few that are several mega-pixels, and so we
resized each image to a fixed width (500 pixels) before run-
ning selective search. On val, selective search resulted in an
average of 2403 region proposals per image with a 91.6\%
recall of all ground-truth bounding boxes (at 0.5 IoU thresh-
old). This recall is notably lower than in PASCAL, where
it is approximately 98\%, indicating significant room for im-
provement in the region proposal stage.

\fontsize{9pt}{11pt}\selectfont
For training data, we formed a set of images and boxes
that includes all selective search and ground-truth boxes
from val1 together with up to N ground-truth boxes per
class from train (if a class has fewer than N ground-truth
boxes in train, then we take all of them). We’ll call this
dataset of images and boxes val1+trainN. In an ablation
study, we show mAP on val2 for N ∈\{0, 500, 1000\} (Sec-
tion 4.5).
Training data is required for three procedures in R-CNN:
(1) CNN fine-tuning, (2) detector SVM training, and (3)
bounding-box regressor training. CNN fine-tuning was run
for 50k SGD iteration on val1+trainN using the exact same
settings as were used for PASCAL. Fine-tuning on a sin-
gle NVIDIA Tesla K20 took 13 hours using Caffe.
For
SVM training, all ground-truth boxes from val1+trainN
were used as positive examples for their respective classes.
Hard negative mining was performed on a randomly se-
lected subset of 5000 images from val1. An initial experi-
ment indicated that mining negatives from all of val1, versus
a 5000 image subset (roughly half of it), resulted in only a
0.5 percentage point drop in mAP, while cutting SVM train-
ing time in half. No negative examples were taken from

Before submitting results to the evaluation server, we
validated data usage choices and the effect of fine-tuning
and bounding-box regression on the val2 set using the train-
ing data described above. All system hyperparameters (e.g.,
SVM C hyperparameters, padding used in region warp-
ing, NMS thresholds, bounding-box regression hyperpa-
rameters) were fixed at the same values used for PAS-
CAL. Undoubtedly some of these hyperparameter choices
are slightly suboptimal for ILSVRC, however the goal of
this work was to produce a preliminary R-CNN result on
ILSVRC without extensive dataset tuning. After selecting
the best choices on val2, we submitted exactly two result
files to the ILSVRC2013 evaluation server. The first sub-
mission was without bounding-box regression and the sec-
ond submission was with bounding-box regression.
For
these submissions, we expanded the SVM and bounding-
box regressor training sets to use val+train1k and val, re-
spectively.
We used the CNN that was fine-tuned on
val1+train1k to avoid re-running fine-tuning and feature
computation.

Table 4 shows an ablation study of the effects of differ-
ent amounts of training data, fine-tuning, and bounding-
box regression. A first observation is that mAP on val2
matches mAP on test very closely.
This gives us confi-
dence that mAP on val2 is a good indicator of test set per-
formance. The first result, 20.9\%, is what R-CNN achieves
using a CNN pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 classifica-
tion dataset (no fine-tuning) and given access to the small
amount of training data in val1 (recall that half of the classes
in val1 have between 15 and 55 examples).
Expanding
the training set to val1+trainN improves performance to
24.1\%, with essentially no difference between N = 500
and N = 1000. Fine-tuning the CNN using examples from
just val1 gives a modest improvement to 26.5\%, however
there is likely significant overfitting due to the small number
of positive training examples. Expanding the fine-tuning
set to val1+train1k, which adds up to 1000 positive exam-
ples per class from the train set, helps significantly, boosting
mAP to 29.7\%. Bounding-box regression improves results
to 31.0\%, which is a smaller relative gain that what was ob-
served in PASCAL.

gions and change the per-class bounding-box regressors to
a single bounding-box regressor, then the systems would
be very similar (modulo some potentially significant differ-
ences in how they are trained: CNN detection fine-tuning,
using SVMs, etc.). It is worth noting that OverFeat has
a significant speed advantage over R-CNN: it is about 9x
faster, based on a figure of 2 seconds per image quoted from
[34]. This speed comes from the fact that OverFeat’s slid-
ing windows (i.e., region proposals) are not warped at the
image level and therefore computation can be easily shared
between overlapping windows. Sharing is implemented by
running the entire network in a convolutional fashion over
arbitrary-sized inputs. Speeding up R-CNN should be pos-
sible in a variety of ways and remains as future work.

Region classification is a standard technique for seman-
tic segmentation, allowing us to easily apply R-CNN to the
PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge. To facilitate a di-
rect comparison with the current leading semantic segmen-
tation system (called O2P for “second-order pooling”) [4],
we work within their open source framework. O2P uses
CPMC to generate 150 region proposals per image and then
predicts the quality of each region, for each class, using
support vector regression (SVR). The high performance of
their approach is due to the quality of the CPMC regions
and the powerful second-order pooling of multiple feature
types (enriched variants of SIFT and LBP). We also note
that Farabet et al. [16] recently demonstrated good results
on several dense scene labeling datasets (not including PAS-
CAL) using a CNN as a multi-scale per-pixel classifier.
We follow [2, 4] and extend the PASCAL segmentation
training set to include the extra annotations made available
by Hariharan et al. [22]. Design decisions and hyperparam-
eters were cross-validated on the VOC 2011 validation set.
Final test results were evaluated only once.

warped window, exactly as we did for detection. However,
these features ignore the non-rectangular shape of the re-
gion. Two regions might have very similar bounding boxes
while having very little overlap. Therefore, the second strat-
egy (fg) computes CNN features only on a region’s fore-
ground mask. We replace the background with the mean
input so that background regions are zero after mean sub-
traction. The third strategy (full+fg) simply concatenates
the full and fg features; our experiments validate their com-
plementarity.

Results on VOC 2011. Table 5 shows a summary of our
results on the VOC 2011 validation set compared with O2P.
(See Appendix E for complete per-category results.) Within
each feature computation strategy, layer fc6 always outper-
forms fc7 and the following discussion refers to the fc6 fea-
tures. The fg strategy slightly outperforms full, indicating
that the masked region shape provides a stronger signal,
matching our intuition. However, full+fg achieves an aver-
age accuracy of 47.9\%, our best result by a margin of 4.2\%
(also modestly outperforming O2P), indicating that the con-
text provided by the full features is highly informative even
given the fg features. Notably, training the 20 SVRs on our
full+fg features takes an hour on a single core, compared to
10+ hours for training on O2P features.
In Table 6 we present results on the VOC 2011 test
set, comparing our best-performing method, fc6 (full+fg),
against two strong baselines. Our method achieves the high-
est segmentation accuracy for 11 out of 21 categories, and
the highest overall segmentation accuracy of 47.9\%, aver-
aged across categories (but likely ties with the O2P result
under any reasonable margin of error). Still better perfor-
mance could likely be achieved by fine-tuning.

近年来，目标检测性能趋于停滞。
表现最好的系统是复杂的集成系统，结合了多种低级图像特征与来自对象检测器和场景分类器的高级上下文信息。本文提出了一种简单且可扩展的目标检测算法，在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上相比之前最佳结果相对提高了30\%。我们通过两个见解实现了这一性能。第一个见解是应用高容量卷积神经网络对自底向上的区域提议进行处理，以定位和分割对象。第二个见解是一种在标注训练数据稀缺的情况下训练大型CNN的范式。我们展示了在网络监督下预训练——用于辅助任务（图像分类，数据丰富）——然后针对目标任务（检测，数据稀缺）微调网络的高度有效性。我们推测，“监督预训练/领域特定微调”范式对于各种数据稀缺的视觉问题将非常有效。
最后，我们指出，通过结合计算机视觉的经典工具和深度学习（自底向上的区域提议和卷积神经网络），我们实现了这些成果具有重要意义。这两个领域不是对立的研究方向，而是自然且不可避免的合作伙伴。

Figure 7: Different object proposal transformations. (A) the
original object proposal at its actual scale relative to the trans-
formed CNN inputs; (B) tightest square with context; (C) tight-
est square without context; (D) warp. Within each column and
example proposal, the top row corresponds to p = 0 pixels of con-
text padding while the bottom row has p = 16 pixels of context
padding.

then scales (isotropically) the image contained in that
square to the CNN input size. Figure 7 column (B) shows
this transformation.
A variant on this method (“tightest
square without context”) excludes the image content that
surrounds the original object proposal. Figure 7 column
(C) shows this transformation. The second method (“warp”)
anisotropically scales each object proposal to the CNN in-
put size. Figure 7 column (D) shows the warp transforma-
tion.

For each of these transformations, we also consider in-
cluding additional image context around the original object
proposal. The amount of context padding (p) is defined as a
border size around the original object proposal in the trans-
formed input coordinate frame. Figure 7 shows p = 0 pix-
els in the top row of each example and p = 16 pixels in
the bottom row. In all methods, if the source rectangle ex-
tends beyond the image, the missing data is replaced with
the image mean (which is then subtracted before inputing
the image into the CNN). A pilot set of experiments showed
that warping with context padding (p = 16 pixels) outper-
formed the alternatives by a large margin (3-5 mAP points).
Obviously more alternatives are possible, including using
replication instead of mean padding. Exhaustive evaluation
of these alternatives is left as future work.

B. 正例与负例及 softmax

在机器学习中，正例和负例的选择对于模型的训练至关重要。正例是指符合模型预期的样本，而负例则是指不符合预期的样本。Softmax 函数通常用于多分类问题中的输出层，它将神经网络的输出转换为概率分布，使得所有类别的概率之和为 1。这样可以有效地评估每个类别的重要性，并选择出最有可能的类别。

有两个设计选择值得进一步讨论。

第一个问题是：为什么在微调CNN和训练目标检测SVM时，正负样本的定义不同？简要回顾一下定义，对于微调，我们将每个对象提议映射到与之最大IoU重叠的真实实例（如果有），如果IoU至少为0.5，则将其标记为匹配的真实类别下的正样本。所有其他提议都被标记为“背景”（即所有类别的负样本）。而在训练SVM时，我们只将真实框作为各自类别的正样本，并将与某一类的所有实例IoU重叠小于0.3的提议标记为该类别的负样本。落在灰色区域（IoU重叠大于0.3但不是真实值）的提议被忽略。

从历史角度来看，我们之所以采用这些定义是因为我们最初是在ImageNet预训练的CNN计算的特征上训练SVM，因此当时并未考虑微调。在这种设置下，我们发现我们所使用的特定标签定义在我们评估的一系列选项中是最佳的（包括我们现在用于微调的设置）。当我们开始使用微调时，最初使用了与SVM训练相同的正负样本定义。然而，我们发现结果比使用当前正负样本定义差得多。

我们的假设是，这种正负样本定义上的差异并不根本重要，而是由于微调数据有限所致。我们的当前方案引入了许多“抖动”示例（那些IoU在0.5到1之间的提议，但不是真实值），这将正样本的数量大约扩大了30倍。我们推测，在微调整个网络以避免过拟合时，需要如此大的数据集。然而，我们也注意到，使用这些“抖动”示例可能是次优的，因为网络没有被微调以实现精确定位。

这引出了第二个问题：为什么在微调之后还要训练SVM？更干净的做法是直接应用微调后的网络的最后一层，这是一个21路softmax回归分类器，作为目标检测器。我们尝试了这种方法，发现VOC 2007上的性能从54.2\%mAP下降到了50.9\%mAP。这种性能下降可能源于几个因素的结合，包括微调中使用的正样本定义没有强调精确定位，以及softmax分类器是在随机采样的负样本上训练的，而不是在用于SVM训练的“难负样本”子集上训练的。

这个结果表明，即使不训练SVM也可以获得接近相同水平的性能。

We use a simple bounding-box regression stage to im-
prove localization performance. After scoring each selec-
tive search proposal with a class-specific detection SVM,
we predict a new bounding box for the detection using a
class-specific bounding-box regressor.
This is similar in
spirit to the bounding-box regression used in deformable
part models [17]. The primary difference between the two
approaches is that here we regress from features computed
by the CNN, rather than from geometric features computed
on the inferred DPM part locations.
The input to our training algorithm is a set of N train-
ing pairs \{(P i, Gi)\}i=1,...,N, where P i = (P i
x, P i
y, P i
w, P i
h)
specifies the pixel coordinates of the center of proposal P i’s
bounding box together with P i’s width and height in pixels.
Hence forth, we drop the superscript i unless it is needed.
Each ground-truth bounding box G is specified in the same
way: G = (Gx, Gy, Gw, Gh). Our goal is to learn a trans-
formation that maps a proposed box P to a ground-truth box
G.
We parameterize the transformation in terms of four
functions dx(P), dy(P), dw(P), and dh(P).
The first
two specify a scale-invariant translation of the center of
P’s bounding box, while the second two specify log-space
translations of the width and height of P’s bounding box.
After learning these functions, we can transform an input
proposal P into a predicted ground-truth box ˆG by apply-
ing the transformation

第二个问题是选择要使用的训练样本对 (P, G) 时必须小心。直观地说，如果 P 距离所有的真实边界框都很远，那么将 P 转换为真实边界框 G 的任务就没有意义。使用像 P 这样的例子会导致无望的学习问题。
因此，我们只从那些至少靠近一个真实边界框的提议 P 中学习。我们通过将 P 分配给与它具有最大 IoU 重叠的真实边界框 G 来实现“接近性”，前提是该重叠大于一个阈值（我们使用验证集将其设置为 0.6）。所有未分配的提议都被丢弃。对于每个对象类别，我们都这样做一次，以便学习一组类特定的边界框回归器。
在测试时，我们对每个提议打分并预测其新的检测窗口只进行一次。原则上，我们可以迭代这个过程（即重新评分新预测的边界框，然后从它预测一个新的边界框，依此类推）。然而，我们发现迭代并不会改善结果。

Figure 12 shows additional visualizations for 20 pool5
units. For each unit, we show the 24 region proposals that
maximally activate that unit out of the full set of approxi-
mately 10 million regions in all of VOC 2007 test.
We label each unit by its (y, x, channel) position in the
6 × 6 × 256 dimensional pool5 feature map. Within each
channel, the CNN computes exactly the same function of
the input region, with the (y, x) position changing only the
receptive field.

In Table 7 we show the per-category segmentation ac-
curacy on VOC 2011 val for each of our six segmentation
methods in addition to the O2P method [4]. These results
show which methods are strongest across each of the 20
PASCAL classes, plus the background class.

F. Analysis of cross-dataset redundancy

One concern when training on an auxiliary dataset is that
there might be redundancy between it and the test set. Even
though the tasks of object detection and whole-image clas-
sification are substantially different, making such cross-set
redundancy much less worrisome, we still conducted a thor-
ough investigation that quantifies the extent to which PAS-
CAL test images are contained within the ILSVRC 2012
training and validation sets. Our findings may be useful to
researchers who are interested in using ILSVRC 2012 as
training data for the PASCAL image classification task.
We performed two checks for duplicate (and near-
duplicate) images. The first test is based on exact matches
of flickr image IDs, which are included in the VOC 2007
test annotations (these IDs are intentionally kept secret for
subsequent PASCAL test sets). All PASCAL images, and
about half of ILSVRC, were collected from flickr.com. This
check turned up 31 matches out of 4952 (0.63\%).
The second check uses GIST [30] descriptor matching,
which was shown in [13] to have excellent performance at
near-duplicate image detection in large (> 1 million) image
collections. Following [13], we computed GIST descrip-
tors on warped 32 × 32 pixel versions of all ILSVRC 2012
trainval and PASCAL 2007 test images.
Euclidean distance nearest-neighbor matching of GIST
descriptors revealed 38 near-duplicate images (including all
31 found by flickr ID matching). The matches tend to vary
slightly in JPEG compression level and resolution, and to a
lesser extent cropping. These findings show that the overlap
is small, less than 1\%. For VOC 2012, because flickr IDs
are not available, we used the GIST matching method only.
Based on GIST matches, 1.5\% of VOC 2012 test images
are in ILSVRC 2012 trainval. The slightly higher rate for
VOC 2012 is likely due to the fact that the two datasets
were collected closer together in time than VOC 2007 and
ILSVRC 2012 were.

v2 CVPR 2014 camera-ready revision. Includes substan-
tial improvements in detection performance brought about
by (1) starting fine-tuning from a higher learning rate (0.001
instead of 0.0001), (2) using context padding when prepar-
ing CNN inputs, and (3) bounding-box regression to fix lo-
calization errors.

Figure 12: We show the 24 region proposals, out of the approximately 10 million regions in VOC 2007 test, that most strongly
activate each of 20 units. Each montage is labeled by the unit’s (y, x, channel) position in the 6 × 6 × 256 dimensional pool5 feature map.
Each image region is drawn with an overlay of the unit’s receptive field in white. The activation value (which we normalize by dividing by
the max activation value over all units in a channel) is shown in the receptive field’s upper-left corner. Best viewed digitally with zoom.
